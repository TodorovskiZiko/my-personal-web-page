        <h1>My Education</h1>

        <p>
          I graduated from <strong>SUGS Orce Nikolov</strong> in Skopje, one of the most well-known high schools in the city. I finished with a perfect average grade of <strong>5.00</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time there, I served as the <strong>Head of the IT Department</strong>, helping both students and teachers by fixing computers, setting up equipment, and solving technical problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was also part of a <strong>startUp idea</strong> team, working on innovation and practical tech solutions. As a young innovator, I became a member of <strong>ImamIdea2</strong> — a platform that helps startup teams connect with sponsors and financial support for their ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          These experiences helped me grow a lot—technically, but also personally. I traveled to different events, participated in activities, and made lifelong friendships that I will always treasure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, I’m proud to be continuing my journey at the <strong>Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering - Skopje (FINKI)</strong>. I’m focused and ready to be just as successful here, with a strong desire to learn, grow, and earn my degree in Software Engineering.
